# Contributing

Please share any general questions, feature requests, or product feedback in our
[Convex Discord Community](https://convex.dev/community). We're particularly
excited to see what you build using Chef!

Please ensure that JavaScript code is formatted with
[eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) and markdown files are
formatted with [prettier](https://prettier.io/).

Chef is a fast moving project developed by a dedicated team. We're excited to
contribute to the community by releasing this code, but we want to manage
expectations as well.

- We value a cohesive product experience for folks building applications using Chef.
- We value transparency in how we operate.

Smaller PRs that affect documentation, comments, or small bugfixes are easy to
review and integrate. For any larger or more fundamental changes, get in touch
with us on Discord before you put in too much work to see if it's consistent
with our product plans. We are generally unlikely to take large or fundamental
changes as community contributions. We think carefully about how new features
contribute to a cohesive product in line with our roadmap, so we cannot promise
that larger PRs will get the same level of attention.
